                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hi, My name is Zion, I am 17 years old this year studying in Singapore Polytechnic, I came from a middle/low
                    socio-economic background, My family always lead a frugal lifestyle and had always told to cherish what
                    I have. What these has led me to become more or less a stay-at-home boy that enjoys entertainment media
                    provided by electronic device rather than to go out and play, I'm embarrassed to say but I am not the
                    most athletic person in my family. I hope that I can interest all of you with my website and my recommendation.</p>

                <h5>More about my hobbies</h5>
                <p>Well since this website focuses on fun and hobbies, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about it,
                    When I was young I did not play much games or watch many different shows on the internet, i would always
                    just watch any and every shows that pop up on the television, It was around when i was primary 4 that
                    i started to venture out and see if there are different kind of entertainment that will satisfy me...
                    well, after that it was a straight fall to abyss. I got hook on numerous western shows and anime and
                    i started to play card games and Blackshot(well, it was popular at one time). However i wasn't hook on
                    to this stuff until I was in Secondary School, At that time, I thought my life was quite boring, I decided
                    that i should try out more games/anime/films to enrich myself in life. On the other hand, i could also
                    use the knowledge I gain from enjoying my hobbies to interact with my friends. Right now, i am also trying
                    to make simple pixel art as a hobby, In fact, all the small icon you see on these website is made by
                    me!

                <h6>What is this Website about ?</h6>
                <p>The purpose of the website is to be able to allow you to be able to enjoy one or more of my myriad of recommendation
                    of things to do, specifically things you can do at home at your free time. The recommendation will include
                    fun and thrilling games that will definitely eat up much of your sleep time, or an awesome anime that
                    you can just sit back on your dinner table and enjoy with your food, prefer something quiet ? you can
                    choose one of the books i recommend to, just be warn that i prefer darker themed media over happy-go-lucky
                    one, but don't worry, there will be some light-hearted one too.
